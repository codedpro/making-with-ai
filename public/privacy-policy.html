            This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or
            controlled by AnyAITool. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and
            such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when
            you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing
            and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that website’s
            own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to collect information about
            you.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-7">Advertising</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            This website may contain third party advertisements and links to third party sites. AnyAITool does not make any
            representation as to the accuracy or suitability of any of the information contained in those advertisements or sites
            and does not accept any responsibility or liability for the conduct or content of those advertisements and sites and
            the offerings made by the third parties.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-5">
            Advertising keeps AnyAITool and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure
            that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-5">
            Third party advertisements and links to other sites where goods or services are advertised are not endorsements or
            recommendations by AnyAITool of the third party sites, goods or services. AnyAITool takes no responsibility for the
            content of any of the ads, promises made, or the quality/reliability of the products or services offered in all
            advertisements.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-7">Cookies for Advertising</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            These cookies collect information over time about your online activity on the website and other online services to
            make online advertisements more relevant and effective to you. This is known as interest-based advertising. They also
            perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing and ensuring that ads are properly
            displayed for advertisers. Without cookies, it’s really hard for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how
            many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-7">Cookies</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            AnyAITool uses "Cookies" to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A Cookie is a small piece of data
            stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to enhance the performance and
            functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality
            like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time you visit the
            website as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously. Most web browsers can be set to disable
            the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on our website
            correctly or at all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mt-7">Blocking and disabling cookies and similar technologies</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Wherever you're located you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar technologies, but this action may
            block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not be able to fully
            utilize all of its features and services. You should also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g.
            saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different browsers make different
            controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser, you
            will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more
            information.

          <h4 class="mt-7">Remarketing Services</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            We use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is the practice
            of serving ads across the internet to people who have already visited your website. It allows your company to seem
            like they're “following” people around the internet by serving ads on the websites and platforms they use most.

          <h4 class="mt-7">Kids' Privacy</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">

            You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data without your permission, please contact Us. If We
            become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental
            consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-7">Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to this Privacy Policy so that they accurately
            reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our
            Service) before we make changes to this Privacy Policy and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into
            effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Privacy Policy. If you do not want
            to agree to this or any updated Privacy Policy, you can delete your account.

            The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our
            customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as
            our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mt-7">What is personal data?</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that
            could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data
            extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions,
            genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
          <ol class="mt-5 list-num-count">
            <li class="mt-5">
              Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way
              that a person would reasonably expect.
            </li>

            <li class="mt-2.5">
              Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.
              Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-2.5">Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
            <li class="mt-2.5">
              People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their
              data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4 class="mt-7">Why is GDPR important?</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect
            and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach.
            Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At AnyAITool we strongly believe that your data privacy is very
            important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this
            new regulation.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-7">Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h4>
          <p class="mt-5">
            We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. AnyAITool processes or
            stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up
            to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of
            Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-5">
            We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to
            access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self-service from the start and
            have always given you access to your data and your customers' data. Our customer support team is here for you to
            answer any questions you might have about working with the API.
